# Godot Lag Compensation: Netfox

This is a continuation of the Brackeys-based multiplayer game where we add support for lag compensation using Netfox. Netfox uses Client-side Prediction and Server reconciliation as a means to provide responsive client movement while maintaining server authority over the player. 

So you no longer have to wait for that "round trip" from hitting a key and waiting for it to come back from the server before moving the player.
